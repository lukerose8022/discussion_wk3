        <p>Hi. My name is Lucas Rosendall. I am currently a student studying at the University of Michigan in the School of information program. I am interested in Archives and Digital Preservation, but I also harbor an enjoyment for coding and the history of technology. My research interests lie at the intersection between instutional practices of statecraft, the archive, and education. More specifically, I am interested in the  techniciy of writing and how the advent of AI marks a change in how we relate to knowledge, and ultimatley, oursleves. </p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to read and write, go on walks, and play video games - I am always interested in building new skills!</p>
